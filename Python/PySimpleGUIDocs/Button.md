### update

Changes some of the settings for the Button Element. Must callÂ `Window.Read`Â orÂ `Window.Finalize`Â prior

Changes will not be visible in your window until you call window.read or window.refresh.

If you change visibility, your element may MOVE. If you want it to remain stationary, use the "layout helper" function "pin" to ensure your element is "pinned" to that location in your layout so that it returns there when made visible.

```python
update(text = None,
    button_color = (None, None),
    disabled = None,

### visible

#### property: visible

Returns visibility state for the element. This is a READONLY property

| Type   | Name       | Meaning                      |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| (bool) | **return** | Visibility state for element |

### widget

#### property: widget

Returns tkinter widget for the element. This is a READONLY property. The implementation is that the Widget member variable is returned. This is a backward compatible addition

| Type             | Name       | Meaning                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| (tkinter.Widget) | **return** | The element's underlying tkinter widget |

### These are non-PEP8 Compliant Methods - do NOT use

The following methods are here for backwards compatibility reference. You will find there are PEP8 versions for each of these methods. The PEP8 versions will be all lower case and have underscores.

### Click

Generates a click of the button as if the user clicked the button Calls the tkinter invoke method for the button

```python
Click()
```

### GetText

Returns the current text shown on a button

```python
GetText()
```

| Type  | Name       | Meaning                                    |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| (str) | **return** | The text currently displayed on the button |

### SetFocus

Sets the current focus to be on this element

``` python
SetFocus(force = False)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

| Type | Name | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
|      |      |         |
bool|force|if True will call focus_force otherwise calls focus_set|

### SetTooltip

Called by application to change the tooltip text for an Element. Normally invoked using the Element Object such as: window.Element('key').SetToolTip('New tip').

```python
SetTooltip(tooltip_text)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

| Type | Name         | Meaning                      |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| str  | tooltip_text | the text to show in tooltip. |

### Update

Changes some of the settings for the Button Element. Must callÂ `Window.Read`Â orÂ `Window.Finalize`Â prior

Changes will not be visible in your window until you call window.read or window.refresh.

If you change visibility, your element may MOVE. If you want it to remain stationary, use the "layout helper" function "pin" to ensure your element is "pinned" to that location in your layout so that it returns there when made visible.

```
Update(text = None,
    button_color = (None, None),
    disabled = None,
    image_data = None,
    image_filename = None,
    visible = None,
    image_subsample = None,
    disabled_button_color = (None, None),
    image_size = None)
```
